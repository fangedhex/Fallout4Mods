Changed all the misc mods from WSE to use the ModCrate nif model not the modbox due to the issues with hoppers and that nif model.
Reduced the scrap out for the ammo scrapper. I felt is was too much compared to average recipe
Added in Hans's Lef Sorter nif model to fix the conveyor issue. Thanks again Hans!
Fixed the ammo builder bug in the builder script for too many output items when the builder amount was changed in the holo tape.
Changed the WEaponsmith Ammo Component builder to create the actual components making it easier to use. Meaning primers and gunpowder come directly out of the machine ready to be used.
Changed the way the Casings kit work to be more useful. Now they will create 1000 of a specfic selected case in the inventory.
Two seperate kits. One for shotgun ammo one for standard brass ammo.
Adjusted the Casings recipe to reflect the amount of casings recieved.
Added items to the terminal display to display locked recipes with missing perks requirments.
Fixed elevated left turn conveyor movement direction.
